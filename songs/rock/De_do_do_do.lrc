[00:27.54] Don't think me unkind
[00:33.65] Words are hard to find
[00:40.28] They're only cheques I've left unsigned
[00:46.59] From the banks of chaos in my mind
[00:53.58] And when their eloquence escapes me
[00:59.62] Their logic ties me up and rapes me
[01:05.92] De do do do, de da da da
[01:09.28] Is all I want to say to you
[01:12.38] De do do do, de da da da
[01:15.80] Their innocence will pull me through
[01:19.00] De do do do, de da da da
[01:22.26] Is all I want to say to you
[01:25.43] De do do do, de da da da
[01:28.76] They're meaningless and all that's true
[01:32.92] Poets, priests and politicians
[01:39.25] Have words to thank for their positions
[01:45.75] Words that scream for your submission
[01:52.58] And no one's jamming their transmission
[01:58.77] 'Cause when their eloquence escapes you
[02:04.96] Their logic ties you up and rapes you
[02:11.07] De do do do, de da da da
[02:14.36] Is all I want to say to you
[02:17.12] De do do do, de da da da
[02:20.71] Their innocence will pull me through
[02:23.86] De do do do, de da da da
[02:27.14] Is all I want to say to you
[02:30.58] De do do do, de da da da
[02:33.75] They're meaningless and all that's true
[02:59.10] De do do do, de da da da
[03:03.02] Is all I want to say to you
[03:06.48] De do do do, de da da da
[03:09.33] Their innocence will pull me through
[03:12.98] De do do do, de da da da
[03:16.25] Is all I want to say to you
[03:19.33] De do do do, de da da da
[03:22.67] They're meaningless and all that's true
[03:26.17]
